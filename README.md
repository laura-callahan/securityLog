# securityLog
A front end mockup of an online security logbook.

This online security logbook proposes an alternative to paper and pen security logging.  Instead of having guests sign in to a paper logbook, forcing security and reception to manually record data, this web application would immediately record results into a database.  The application can be modified to comply with a variety of security requirements, such as recording nationality, gathering an emergency contact, among other options.
